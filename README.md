Love interacting with people and like to hear about their achievements specially software engineers ! Question is why not ? They are making an impact by creating beautiful software for people to use 🙏.

I have great interest in Product development and growth. As I have completely Research, idealise and make the product fly into market with increase the users from 0 to 150K from scratch in my past venture with friends.
