I'm Manish Shekhawat ( https://www.linkedin.com/in/manish-shekhawat-99a440141/)  and I'm a full stack recruiter with deep interest in sourcing & recruiting. 

As a recruiter I'm interested in finding right people for the right opportunity. I'm passionate about technology🕵️‍♂️ 

Creative in resume making 😎 Love to play and get my hands dirty by sourcing through Github, Stack-overflow, Meet-ups and Google search. Exploring new tools :-) as I believe learning is ongoing.

Love teaching & help people regarding the recruitment fundamentals and hack( Tools).

Love interacting with people and like to hear about their achievements specially software engineers ! Question is why not ? They are making an impact by creating beautiful software for people to use 🙏.

I have great interest in Product development and growth. As I have completely Research, idealise and make the product fly into market with increase the users from 0 to 150K from scratch in my past venture with friends.

Playing basketball🏀 and soccer ⚽️ is my 1st love❤️ An Army brat🇮🇳 Hiking✌️ Cooking 😎 Runner.
